# Change: Expand TechNewsHub Spec Phase 2

## Why
Prompts 19-40 introduce critical editorial, governance, and growth tooling that the initial TechNewsHub spec does not yet cover. We need a structured extension capturing print optimization, content mobility, discoverability, governance, automation, compliance, and quality gates to unlock a production-ready newsroom platform.

## What Changes
- Define print stylesheet expectations, editorial import/export pipelines, and omnichannel publishing workflows.
- Specify advanced search, widget/menu builders, content calendar, and editorial assistance (link suggestions, alt-text checks).
- Add governance and reliability capabilities: maintenance mode, activity log, notifications, 2FA, API usage monitoring, GDPR support, spam protection, and final quality safeguards.
- Capture automation features for social auto-posting, email digests, A/B testing, performance dashboards, and broken link checks.

## Impact
- Affected specs: frontend-experience, admin-panel, advanced-features, quality-ops, api-platform, platform-core (new sub-capabilities to be added where missing).
- Affected code: Tailwind print styles, Blade templates/components, admin UI modules, console commands/queues, notification system, security/auth flows, analytics dashboards, import/export pipelines.
